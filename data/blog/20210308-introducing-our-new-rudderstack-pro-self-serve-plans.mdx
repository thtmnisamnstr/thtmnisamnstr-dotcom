## Upgrade to RudderStack Pro with just a credit card. No more complicated invoicing processes or mandatory sales calls.

Today, we are announcing the availability of our RudderStack Pro self-serve plans. Now, you can purchase RudderStack Pro, up to 100M events per month, with just a credit card. No complicated invoicing processes and no mandatory discussions with salespeople.

_We also announced our product redesign along with our RudderStack Pro self-serve plans. Read about that in our blog post- [Good Products Deserve Good Design: Introducing the Redesigned RudderStack](https://rudderstack.com/blog/good-products-deserve-good-design-introducing-the-redesigned-rudderstack)._


## Our Self-Serve Plans

All of our self-serve plans give you access to RudderStack Pro (you can learn more about how our Pro tier compares to our Free and Enterprise tiers on [our Pricing page](https://rudderstack.com/pricing/)). We offer three plans based on monthly event volume- monthly, pay-as-you-go, and reduced annual pricing.

| **Event Volume**      | **Monthly Price** | **Annual Price**<br />_20% discount_ |
| --------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Up to 25M events/mth  | $900              | $9,000                               |
| Up to 50M events/mth  | $1,200            | $12,000                              |
| Up to 100M events/mth | $1,800            | $18,000                              |

If you want access to RudderStack Enterprise or your event volumes are greater than 100m events per month, contact our sales team - by either [requesting a demo](https://resources.rudderstack.com/request-a-demo) or sending us a message in our application like in the image below.
