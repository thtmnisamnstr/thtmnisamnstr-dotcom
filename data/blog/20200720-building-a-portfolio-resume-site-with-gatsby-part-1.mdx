My [personal website](https://thtmnisamnstr.com) sucks.
![Alt Text](/images/blog/20200720-building-a-portfolio-resume-site-with-gatsby-part-1/7vq44fvx5kehvo54rkol.png)

I haven't touched it since 2017, and it looks dated. It doesn't have any of the writing I've been doing for work included either. It's just not a good showcase of me or my work. So I'm going to update it.

We started using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org) for a few of the company websites where I work, [New Relic](https://newrelic.com). So I'll use Gatsby for my site too. I'm choosing the [Novela theme](https://github.com/narative/gatsby-theme-novela) by narative, because it's popular, and I'm basic.

I figured I'd document it and share it here. Hopefully somebody finds it useful.

* **[GitHub Repo for this website](https://github.com/thtmnisamnstr/thtmnisamnstr-dotcom)**
* **[My personal website](https://thtmnisamnstr.com)**

*FYI, I'm using a Mac, so there may be some Mac-specific commands.*

## Install prerequisites
* Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
  * `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"`
* Install XCode Command Line Tools
  * `xcode-select --install`
* Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
  * `brew install git`
  * `git config --global user.name "Your Name"`
  * `git config -- global user.email "your@email.com"`
* Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
  * `brew install node`

## Install Gatsby and create your starter site
* Install the [Gatsby CLI](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-cli/)
  * `npm install -g gatsby-cli`
* cd to the directory you want your site's root directory to be in (e.g. I have a development sandbox folder that I put all of my dev projects in).
* Create a starter site (using the Novela theme by narative)
  * `gatsby new [site-root-directory] https://github.com/narative/gatsby-starter-novela`

*The last of your terminal output should be a confirmation like below:*

```
Your new Gatsby site has been successfully bootstrapped. Start developing it by running:
  cd thtmnisamnstr-dotcom
  gatsby develop
```

* Build and run your starter site
  * `cd [site-root-directory]`
  * `gatsby develop`

*The last of your terminal output should be a confirmation like below:*

```
You can now view site in the browser.
  http://localhost:8000/

View GraphiQL, an in-browser IDE, to explore your site's data and schema⠀
  http://localhost:8000/___graphql⠀

Note that the development build is not optimized.
To create a production build, use gatsby build

success Building development bundle - 14.604s
```

* Open your browser, and go to http://localhost:8000/

## Create your GitHub repo
* Login to [GitHub](https://github.com). Make an account if you don’t already have one.
* Create a new repo
![Alt Text](/images/blog/20200720-building-a-portfolio-resume-site-with-gatsby-part-1/3suf2ia4nintz57znb6c.png)
* Name it. Don’t initialize with a readme, add a .gitignore, nor a license. Click Create Repository.
![Alt Text](/images/blog/20200720-building-a-portfolio-resume-site-with-gatsby-part-1/r4bo0jfdgmn5jmtpy385.png)
* In Terminal...
  * `cd [site-root-directory]`
  * `git remote add origin https://github.com/[your-github-username]/[site-root-directory].git`
  * `git push -u origin master`
* In your repo on GitHub...
  * Create New File
![Alt Text](/images/blog/20200720-building-a-portfolio-resume-site-with-gatsby-part-1/kupwzofa5s42pre9b6by.png)
  * Type “license", and click the Choose License Template button
![Alt Text](/images/blog/20200720-building-a-portfolio-resume-site-with-gatsby-part-1/qsqhkr3n0h39nmbw8mnp.png)
  * Choose MIT License. Enter your full name. Click Review & Submit.
![Alt Text](/images/blog/20200720-building-a-portfolio-resume-site-with-gatsby-part-1/i1jzqmivjo9uaef7dwdh.png)

![Alt Text](/images/blog/20200720-building-a-portfolio-resume-site-with-gatsby-part-1/itm7a8moehzi58q09qj1.png)

**Note:** *You may have to merge a pull request if “Commit directly to the master branch.” wasn’t selectable in the previous screen.*

* In Terminal...
  * `git pull`

**Boom!**
You just pulled down the MIT license file from your GitHub repo.

## Rename your repo's default branch from Master to Main
#### *...because nobody likes outdated terms, like Master, that are unnecessary references to slavery.*
* In Terminal...
  * `git branch -m master main`
  * `git push -u origin main`

*Your terminal output should be something like below:*

```
Total 0 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
remote: 
remote: Create a pull request for 'main' on GitHub by visiting:
remote:      https://github.com/thtmnisamnstr/thtmnisamnstr-dotcom/pull/new/main
remote: 
To https://github.com/thtmnisamnstr/thtmnisamnstr-dotcom.git
 * [new branch]      main -> main
Branch 'main' set up to track remote branch 'main' from 'origin'.
```

* In your GitHub repo...
  * Click Settings on your repo's navigation bar
![Alt Text](/images/blog/20200720-building-a-portfolio-resume-site-with-gatsby-part-1/klqh120pdq2x1p2bagga.png)

  * Click the Update button
![Alt Text](/images/blog/20200720-building-a-portfolio-resume-site-with-gatsby-part-1/bzsdp1nics2fciynedcd.png)
  * A warning modal will pop-up. Click the "I understand, update the default branch" button
![Alt Text](/images/blog/20200720-building-a-portfolio-resume-site-with-gatsby-part-1/alz90bm21kdfxfn7x29o.png)

**Boom!**
Now your repo's default branch is named Main.

**That's it for today.**
*I'll post a more heavy duty tutorial next week on how to customize your new site, tailor it to you, build a resume page, and make your first post.*
