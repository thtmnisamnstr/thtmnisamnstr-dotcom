## Why have this blog?

> Because sharing is learning

I believe noting down and sharing is the best way to learn!
So I created this blog, where I over-engineering stuff, keep things that I learned, find useful, and necessary to save for later (cause I always forget stuff and don't wanna googling the correct answer every time I need).

Beyond technical stuff, there are personal thoughts about work and life from the perspective of a Software Engineer.

It would be highly appreciated if I could read your comment or hear your thoughts on what I wrote <Twemoji emoji="clinking-beer-mugs" />

## Tech stack

This blog is hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) using **Tailwind Nextjs Starter Blog**.

A huge thanks to [Timothy Lin](https://twitter.com/timlrxx) for the minimal, lightweight, and super easy-to-customize blog starter.

A few major changes from the original template:

- Upgrading to React 18, latest version of `mdx-bundler`, all `rehype`/`remark` plugins and dependencies are up-to-date <Twemoji emoji="inbox-tray" />
- Adopting `typescript` <Twemoji emoji="party-popper" />

- See my [repository](https://github.com/hta218/leo-blog) for this blog.
- The legacy version built with **Gatsby** can be found [here](https://leo-blog-legacy.vercel.app/).
