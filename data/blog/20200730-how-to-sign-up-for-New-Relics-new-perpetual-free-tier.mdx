***This post was originally published on [Dev.to](https://dev.to/newrelic/how-to-sign-up-for-new-relic-s-new-perpetual-free-tier-1ebn). I wrote this between the hours of 5:30am and 8:00am while I was online in our social media virtual warroom for our July 30 launch of our new company strategy which includes a no credit card free-tier. There was already a [press release](https://ir.newrelic.com/press-releases/Press-Release-Details/2020/New-Relic-Delivers-Reimagined-Observability-Platform-With-Unified-User-Experience-and-Simple-Predictable-Pricing-to-Help-Companies-Create-More-Perfect-Software/default.aspx), a bunch of blog posts ([blog 1](https://blog.newrelic.com/product-news/new-relic-one-observability-made-simple/), [blog 2](http://blog.newrelic.com/product-news/prometheus-grafana-telemetry-data-platform/), [blog 3](http://blog.newrelic.com/product-news/introducing-telemetry-data-platform/), [blog 4](http://blog.newrelic.com/product-news/reimagined-new-relic-one-experience/), and [blog 5](http://blog.newrelic.com/product-news/simple-pricing/)), a bunch of YouTube videos ([video 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seak6teO7jY), [video 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjkHQDS870k), [video 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbM9dyRF1Kc), and [video 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvqBp2joY5Q)). I wanted to setup my own free-tier account anyway and noticed that we didn't have a super simple walkthrough of how to do that. So I wrote one.***

New Relic is a company built by developers for developers, but the feedback that customers have given us is that observability is complicated and New Relic is not making it easier to collect complete telemetry. *Also, we're expensive.*

**Today, that changes.**
We're making big changes today. We are making it easier and more economical to use New Relic. [Read more here](https://blog.newrelic.com/product-news/new-relic-one-observability-made-simple/).
* We are introducing a perpetual free tier.
  * 100 GB/month of data ingest included.
  * 1 full access user (Telemetry Data Platform, Full-Stack Observability, and Applied Intelligence)
  * Unlimited free basic users (Telemetry Data Platform data exploration, dashboarding, and New Relic One application building. No Full-Stack Observability or Applied Intelligence access)
* We simplified [our packaging and pricing](https://blog.newrelic.com/product-news/simple-pricing/).
  * [Telemetry Data Platform](https://newrelic.com/platform/telemetry-data-platform) - consumption-based pricing, $0.25/GB of data ingest *which is a great deal*. Super cool if you believe in open source like me, because [we are supporting more and more open sources of telemetry data](https://blog.newrelic.com/product-news/introducing-telemetry-data-platform/).
  * [Full-Stack Observability](https://newrelic.com/platform/full-stack-observability) - All of the tools developers love from New Relic (APM, Infrastructure, Browser, Mobile, etc.), all in one UI, now priced per-seat instead of per-product
  * [Applied Intelligence](https://newrelic.com/platform/applied-intelligence) - AIOps capabilities like proactive anomaly detection (to catch problems before they occur), incident intelligence (to reduce unnecessary alerts and prioritize issues easily), and incident correlation (to reduce unnecessary alerts, understand the potential impact of an issue quickly, and route an issue to the right people automatically)

[Sign-up today](https://newrelic.com/signup). It's free, it's easy, and it makes it easier to build better software.
