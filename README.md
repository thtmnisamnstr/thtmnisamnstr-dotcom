# My üè† on the ‚òÅÔ∏è

My personal over-engineering site on the cloud.

## Motivation

> Sharing is learning!

I believe noting down and sharing is the best way to learn! So I created this blog, where I keep things that I learned, find useful, and necessary to save for later (cause I always forget stuff and don't wanna googling the correct answer every time I need)

Beyond technical stuff, there are personal thoughts about work and life from the perspective of a software engineer.

It would be highly appreciated if I could read your comment on what I wrote.

## Stack

This blog is hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) using **Tailwind Nextjs Starter Blog**.

A huge thanks to [Timothy Lin](https://twitter.com/timlrxx) for the minimal, lightweight, and super easy-to-customize blog starter.

A few major changes from the original template:

- Upgrading to React 18, latest version of `mdx-bundler`, all `rehype`/`remark` plugins and dependencies are up-to-date üì•
- Adopting `typescript` üéâ

_And yes! This blog have a legacy version built with **Gatsby** which can be found [here](https://leo-blog-legacy.vercel.app/)_.
