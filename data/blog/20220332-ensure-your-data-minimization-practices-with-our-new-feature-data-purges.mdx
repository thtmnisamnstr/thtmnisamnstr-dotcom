**_This post was originally published on [Twilio Segment's blog](https://segment.com/blog/ensure-data-minimization-practices-with-data-purges/)._**
<br />

Today we’re introducing [Data Purges](http://segment.com/docs/privacy/account-deletion/) — a new way to 
protect the privacy and security of your customers’ data.

Businesses are increasingly aware that the privacy and security of their customer data is important. They 
put safeguards in place to comply with regulations and to protect personally identifiable information 
(PII), protected health information (PHI), or generally sensitive information about their customers. But 
one key and often underemphasized component of data privacy and security is **_data minimization_**.

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) established seven principles that many companies use as a 
framework for their own data privacy programs. Data minimization is one of them. 

Data minimization is the principle that any organization collecting personal data should be deliberate 
about the data they collect and only collect what is needed to provide their product or service. Not 
collecting extra customer data “just in case”. Not stockpiling historic data in hopes it might be useful 
for something else in the future. Data minimization also means deleting data that’s no longer needed.

In the age of big data, many organizations now have innumerable opportunities to easily collect data about 
their users, and, in some cases, it was standard to store this data indefinitely. This standard has 
changed. As privacy legislation continues to evolve, having a sound approach to data minimization is key.

## Announcing Data Purges
Good data doesn’t just mean high-quality, complete, and actionable data. It also means ensuring the 
privacy and security of the personal data of your customers and making sure every vendor that touches your 
customer data does too. We understand that our stance and policies toward data privacy and security can 
have real-world impacts on your business. We work hard to develop and adhere to responsible and respectful 
data privacy and security standards at Twilio Segment.

To help you better ensure the privacy and security of your customers’ data and practice data minimization, 
we are happy to announce that Twilio Segment now offers **data purge** functionality. Data purges let 
Twilio Segment customers, current and former, completely purge all their customer data from our systems.

You can initiate a data purge by navigating to your workspace settings in the Twilio Segment app ...

... and deleting your workspace.

When a data purge is initiated, all customer data associated with your workspace will be purged from all 
of Twilio Segment’s internal data stores within 30 days. Please be aware that data purges are for Twilio 
Segment data stores only and these deletions are not forwarded to your connected destination tools. 

Even if you delete your workspace and purge all of your data from Twilio Segment systems, you may still 
need to make additional deletion requests with your destination vendors.

If you deleted your workspace before March 31st, 2022, and would like to ensure that your old workspace’s 
data has been purged, you can send us a request at [friends@segment.com](mailto: friends@segment.com) 
with your workspace slug, and a member of our team will respond to help.

## Twilio Segment helps you be proactive about data privacy and security
In addition to data purges, Twilio Segment offers several features to help you take a proactive approach 
to data privacy and security. Some features such as [Protocols](https://segment.com/product/protocols/), 
[Destination Functions](https://segment.com/docs/connections/functions/destination-functions/), 
[Destination Filters](https://segment.com/docs/connections/destinations/destination-filters/), and 
[Warehouse Selective Sync](https://segment.com/docs/connections/storage/warehouses/warehouse-syncs/#warehouse-selective-sync), 
help you minimize the data you collect through transformations and filtering. Other features are more 
comprehensive and address specific data privacy and security needs.

### User Deletion & Suppression
We provide you mechanisms to comply with the end user’s Right to be Forgotten and Right to Object under 
GDPR and CCPA by offering [User Deletion and Suppression](https://segment.com/docs/privacy/user-deletion-and-suppression/). 
If a customer chooses to revoke or alter their consent to data collection, you can use our deletion and 
suppression APIs to block ongoing data collection about a user. In addition, you can delete all historical 
data about them across Twilio Segment systems, send delete messages to all connected raw data sources, 
and forward deletion requests to a growing number of supported tools downstream.

### Privacy Portal
We introduced [Privacy Portal](https://segment.com/product/privacy-portal/) in 2019. It assists you in 
your compliance with GDPR and CCPA by offering tools for creating and maintaining a comprehensive data 
inventory. The data inventory allows you to create a centralized repository of all the properties you 
collect and classifies them by risk from low to high. Customers can also monitor changes to the inventory 
with real-time alerts and enforce standard privacy controls.

### Twilio Segment in the EU
In January 2022, we launched [Twilio Segment in the EU](https://segment.com/docs/guides/regional-segment/). 
It gives you Connections, Protocols, and Personas with data ingestion, processing, storage, and audience 
creation done on infrastructure hosted in the EU. It makes it easy to collect, unify, and activate your 
customer data in any system where you need it while helping protect the data privacy of end users in the 
EU by giving you the control to keep your customers’ data in the EU.
