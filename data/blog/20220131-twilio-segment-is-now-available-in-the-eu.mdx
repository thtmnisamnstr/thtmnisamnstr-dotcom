It's been a year-and-a-half since the Schrems II ruling raised questions about the lawfulness of data 
transfers from the EU to third countries, such as the US. To address these concerns, last March [we 
announced our roadmap for Regional Twilio Segment in the EU](https://segment.com/blog/get-data-residency-ready/), 
which detailed our plans and timelines to introduce data ingestion, processing, and storage in the EU.  
  
We committed to delivering an EU-localized product for Connections, Protocols, and Personas by January 
2022. And that's what we are delivering today. **We're excited to reach another milestone in our Regional 
Twilio Segment roadmap and announce the availability of [Regional Twilio Segment in the EU](https://segment.com/product/gdpr/) 
to all new Business Tier customers.**  
  
Regional Twilio Segment is [the worlds #1 Customer Data Platform (CDP)](https://learn.segment.com/number1cdp/) 
– Twilio Segment – deployed in the EU. It gives you Connections, Protocols, and Personas with data 
ingestion, processing, storage, and audience creation done on infrastructure hosted in the EU.  
  
Regional Twilio Segment makes it easy to collect, unify, and activate your customer data in any system 
where you need it while giving you the tools and controls to help enable compliance with EU data 
regulations like GDPR and Schrems II.

Here's a quick rundown of Regional Segment in the EU's key benefits:
*   **Ingest customer data in the EU:** Regional data ingestion lets you collect customer data in the EU 
    through our endpoint in Dublin, Ireland. With regional data ingestion, you have more control to 
    keep data in the EU.
*   **Process customer data in the EU:** Regional data processing lets you process your customer data in 
    the EU. With regional data processing, customer data is processed, filtered, validated, and 
    deduplicated on infrastructure hosted in the EU.
*   **Store customer data in the EU.** Regional data storage helps you reduce long-term data exposure. It 
    lets you store your event data, including the personal data of your customers, in Segment-hosted 
    archives in the EU. 
*   **Personalize every interaction without sacrificing your data etiquette.** Regional Personas helps 
    you create real-time audiences, computed traits, SQL traits, and Journeys in the EU. With regional 
    Personas, data storage and processing happen on infrastructure hosted in the EU.
